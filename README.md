**SPLITCO**
This webapp is hosted online through heroku, and uses a SUPABASE as a way to store user information, 
as well as different metrics for user wrokouts the individual users create.

The main function of this webapp is for users to create a workout split that has different days, and exercises
which have different numbers of reps and sets.

These workouts are then stored on supabase and then shared for others to see on the public workouts section/
Another service that this webapp inlcudes, a rep range calculator for three main excercises, Squat, Bench, and Deadlift
